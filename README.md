# tower_crane_adaptive_fuzzy_smc

## Introduction

This contains MATLAB/Simulink files for the implementation of an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller to control a tower crane system to track reference trajectories while eliminating payload oscillation. For more theoretical details, please refer to our paper.s. ["A Fuzzy Approximation Supported Model-Free Tracking Control Design for Tower Crane Systems"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-3394-3_8)
